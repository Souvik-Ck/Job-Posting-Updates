The current manual process for updating Position details leads to delays in communication and lack of visibility, creating inefficiencies for applicants and internal stakeholders. 
To address this, the company requires an automated, scalable, and secure system to:

Notify job applicants of updates in real-time.
Log changes for internal visibility.
Ensure a loosely coupled architecture for easy extensibility.




Proposed Solution
We recommend implementing a solution based on Platform Events and Event-Driven Architecture, which ensures real-time updates, flexibility, and modularity.



Solution Components
1. Platform Event for Position Updates
Create a Position Update Platform Event that captures changes made to Position records.
This event serves as the central hub for broadcasting updates, ensuring a loosely coupled architecture. New subscribers can be added without altering the existing system.
2. Event Subscribers
Two primary subscribers handle the automation tasks:

Notification Subscriber (Flow/Trigger):
Listens to the platform event and sends notifications to associated applicants.
Uses customizable templates for targeted communication, including:
Updated fields
Reason for update (if available)
Position details
Logging Subscriber (Flow/Trigger):
Creates a detailed log record capturing:
Updated fields
User who made the change
Timestamp of the update

3. Field Tracking for Accurate Logs
Enable Field History Tracking on the Position object for critical fields (e.g., job description, required skills).
Use this tracking data to generate detailed logs.

4. Notification Mechanism
Use Email Alerts or Push Notifications (depending on the applicant's preference) for sending updates.
Ensure content customization via a Notification Template Management System.

5. Error Handling
Implement robust error-handling mechanisms:
Use Retry Mechanisms for failed notifications or log entries.
Log errors in a separate Error Log Object for review and resolution.
6. Security
Restrict access to:
Update logs: Ensure only authorized personnel can view them.
Notifications: Ensure sensitive applicant data is protected.
Use platform security features (e.g., Field-Level Security, Permission Sets) to enforce access control.
