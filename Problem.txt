5. Use Case : Job Posting Updates



Business Need:
Our company frequently updates Position details such as the job description, required skills, or even the hiring manager. These updates are critical for both
current job applicants and internal stakeholders. However, our current process is manual and error-prone, leading to:

•Delayed Communication: Applicants are not informed promptly about position changes, potentially causing frustration and impacting their application decisions.
•Lack of Visibility: Internal teams, especially hiring managers, are not always aware of position modifications, which can affect their recruitment strategies
and coordination.


We need a solution to automate the following actions whenever a Position record is updated:


1. Loosely Coupled Architecture : 
Based on the same event , we should be able to add additional subscribers to the Job update event.
2. Notify Job Applicants: 
Automatically send notifications to all applicants associated with the updated Position, informing them about the specific changes made.
3.Maintain an Update Log: 
Create a detailed log record capturing:
 Which fields in the Position were updated
 The user who made the changes
 Date and time of the update

This automation will ensure timely communication, improve transparency, and streamline our recruitment process.



Functional Requirements 
Real-time Updates: The system must trigger notifications and create log entries immediately after a Position record is updated.
Accuracy: The notifications and log entries must accurately reflect the specific fields that were modified in the Position.
Targeted Communication: Notifications should only be sent to applicants linked to the updated Position.



Technical Requirements

• Platform Event on Position Object: 
A platform event should broadcast the changes per record. These broadcasts are to be subscribed by subscribers
(Event Triggered Flow / Apex Trigger on Position - Platform event).

• Subtasks via Flows/Triggers:
Subtask 1: A (subscriber) Flow or trigger should handle sending notifications to job applicants.
Subtask 2: A (subscriber) another Flow or trigger should create the log record of Position updates.

• Field Tracking: The log record should store information about the updated fields, user, and timestamp.



Additional Considerations

• Notification Content: The notification template should be customizable to include relevant details about the Position update.
• Error Handling: The system should include error handling mechanisms to ensure notifications and log entries are created successfully even if there are
issues with specific records or data.
• Security: Access to the update log should be restricted to authorized personnel.
